# Parking-Lot-Management-System-Extended-Version
//This is the extended version of parking lot management system that we did previously as group assignment. We improve and expand the overall system to suit the requirement of our group project


1.	Introduction
An average car is parked 95 percent of the time (Morris 2016). This, along with the steadily increasing number of people buying car every year, create a serious problem that needs to be addressed. Not only parking slot takes up a lot of spaces, the act of paying parking fees can sometime takes quite a long time, thus hindering people from doing their activities.
To reduce wasted space and promote efficient time usage, a good parking system is needed. Our project offers a parking system that has a lot of features to reduce time and space taken while doing car parking. With our parking system, we believe we can help resolving the parking problems.

2.	Ojectives
The main objective of this project is to avoid the congestion in the car parking area by implementing a parking management system. Normally, at public places such as multiplex theaters, market areas, hospitals, function-halls, offices and shopping malls, one will experience the discomfort in looking out for a vacant parking slot, even though it is a paid facility with an attendant/ security guard. The problem, sometimes, also continue to appear when people are trying to get out from the parking slot thank to the inefficient parking fee payment system.
By implementing a smart parking system, we can reduce traffic by making it easier to locate empty parking spaces, thus lowering the risk of distracted driving. It can also automate the payment process to make the process of going out smoother. Overall, we aim that our parking system would save time and provide comfortable hassle-free parking experience to the users.

3.	Features and Functionalities

a.	Automated Parking access
The Car Parking System will control and track parking facility requirements, and it will be designed to control car parking slots and provide management with valuable reports and details. 

b.	Parking Guidance Systems-
This software will direct vehicles to the nearest accessible parking spot. In here, real-time data is used to refine and increase the system's effectiveness.

c.	Auto-Generated Ticket Passes-
QR code-based passes are instantly auto-generated for a visitor. When any vehicle will enter the parking area, they have to cross through a barrier which will give them a receipt with QR code scanner. The Ticketing System will be programed to the clients parking policies and integrated with the ticketing dispenser machines and Payment systems.

d.	Automatic Number Plate Recognition Readers-
The ANPR system enables monitoring of every car entering & exiting the premises, monitoring the complete activity of the parking area. 

e.	Duration management-
The program will calculate the time while the vehicles are staying in the lot. With the time management, the system will provide the amount of money to pay at Auto-pay station. 

f.	Support Membership Management-
The system will recognize the membership card specifically. Also, it will support the RFID transaction for the registered members to go through easily without any hassle.
